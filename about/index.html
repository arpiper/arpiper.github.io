      A University of Washington grad with a degree in Applied and Computational Math Sciences. I love all things math, science and the outdoors.

      My primary technologies are JavaScript, Python, PHP and HTML5 and CSS3. 
      I have a preference for the lighter JavaScript frameworks like Svelte and VueJS and prefer using Python/Django for 
      backend use due to its ease of readability. However this doesn't limit my openness to new or different 
      technologies for any project.

      Growing up in the cub scouts and boy scouts I've always an affinity for the outdoors and spending time in nature whether it's hiking, camping, climbing or simply going for a run. Since being my freshman year of college rock climbing has been a major passion of mine and most of my time spent outside is usually climbing at the local crag, primarily sport climbing. Still looking for that 5.13 send.

      Running began as means to try and slim done in order to improve my climbing, because the less I weigh the easier it should be to climb up a wall. And while my climbing has improved I can't say I was entirely successful with losing weight, food is just too delicious. I certainly started a bit too aggressively running too fast. This resulted in a bad case of runners knee. However (un)fortunately this coincided with a rolled ankle from a bouldering fall and forced me to stop running for about a month. I was able to recover and started back up smarter and slower. My roommate convinced me to run a half marathon and then I decided to go a for a full marathon the following year. Now I've run 5 fulls and plan on continuing for as long as I can. <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/2821222" target="_blank">Strava</a>
