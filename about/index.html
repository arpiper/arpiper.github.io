      <p>
      A University of Washington grad with a degree in Applied and Computational Math Sciences. I love all things math, science and the outdoors.

        <h4>Technologies</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Javascript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
          <li>HTML5/CSS3</li>

      </div>
      <p>
      My primary technologies are JavaScript, Python, PHP and HTML5 and CSS3. 
      I have a preference for the lighter JavaScript frameworks like Svelte and VueJS and prefer using Python/Django for 
      backend use due to its ease of readability. However this doesn't limit my openness to new or different 
      technologies for any project.

      <p>
      Growing up in the cub scouts and boy scouts I've always an affinity for the outdoors and 
      spending time in nature whether it's hiking, camping, climbing or simply going for a run.<wbr> 
      Since being my freshman year of college rock climbing has been a major passion of mine and most of my time spent outside is usually climbing at the local crag, primarily sport climbing. Still looking for that 5.13 send.
      </p>
      <p>
      I've been an avid runner for about 5 years now. <wbr>
      Having started simply to get myself in better shape and slim down a bit for climbing.<wbr> 
      After running in a Ragnar relay and being convinced to run the Seattle Half Marathon I was hooked. <wbr>
      I've now run 5 full marathons, including Boston, and multiple half's and 5k's with no plans of slowing down. <wbr>
      Just the opposite actually.
