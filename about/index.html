      <p>
      Growing up in the cub scouts and boy scouts I've always had an affinity for the outdoors and 
      spending time in nature whether it's hiking, camping, climbing or simply going for a run.<wbr> 
      Since being my freshman year of college rock climbing has been a major passion of mine and<wbr>
      most of my time on weekends is spent outside climbing at the local crag, primarily sport climbing. Still looking for that 5.13 send.
      </p>
      <p>
      I've been an avid runner for about 5 years now. <wbr>
      Having started simply to get myself in better shape and slim down a bit for climbing.<wbr> 
      After running in a Ragnar relay and being convinced to run the Seattle Half Marathon I was hooked. <wbr>
      I've now run 5 full marathons, including Boston, and multiple half's and 5k's with no plans of slowing down. <wbr>
      Just the opposite actually.
