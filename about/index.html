  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
  A University of Washington grad with a degree in Applied and Computational Math Sciences. I love all things math, science and the outdoors. 
  </p>
  <p>
  My primary technologies are JavaScript, Python, PHP and HTML5 and CSS3. 
  I have a preference for the lighter JavaScript frameworks like Svelte and VueJS and prefer using Python/Django for 
  backend use due to its ease of readability. However this doesn't limit my openness to new or different 
  technologies for any project.
  </p>
  <p>
  Away from a computer I can be found rock climbing, running and generally spending time in the outdoors 
  or hanging out with friends and playing board games.
